- 👋 Hi, I’m @cmart152

- 👀 I’m interested in ...cycling and walking, especially in the area I live in the north west of England. I also have keen interest in technology, science and 
engineering, I really enjoy keeping up to date with whats new with regards to said subjects and would love to be a part of it all

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... software development with The Odin Project, the course content is excellent and I am very appreciative. So far software development
is something I am finding to be incredibly empowering and the tools we use are like nothing I have experienced before

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...collaberating in my work in my previous line of work (construction) isn't something that is really talked about or embraced,
currently this doesn't come natural to me but I hope it will eventually

- 📫 How to reach me ...chester.martin89@gmail.com
